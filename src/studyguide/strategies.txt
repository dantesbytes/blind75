The term "compression strategy" in
the context of algorithmic problem-solving
 typically refers to techniques used to reduce
  the size or complexity of data or representations
   while preserving essential information. In algorithms,
    compression strategies are often employed to optimize
     memory usage, improve runtime efficiency, or facilitate
      faster processing. Here are some similar strategies or
      techniques related to compression:

1. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**:

Run-length encoding is a simple form
of data compression where sequences

of the same value (runs) are stored
 as a single data value and count.
 It's commonly used for compressing
 data with long sequences of repeated
 values.

2. **Huffman Coding**:
Huffman coding is a widely
used algorithm for lossless
data compression that assigns
variable-length codes to input
characters based on their frequencies.
Characters that occur more frequently
are assigned shorter codes, resulting
in more efficient compression.

3. **Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Compression**:
LZW is a dictionary-based compression
algorithm that replaces repetitive
patterns of data with references
to a dictionary of previously
encountered patterns. It's commonly
used in file compression formats
like GIF and TIFF.

4. **Delta Encoding**:
Delta encoding is a technique where
differences between successive data
values are encoded rather than the
actual values themselves. It's often
used for compressing time-series data
or data with predictable trends.

5. **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**:
The Burrows-Wheeler Transform is a
reversible transformation technique
used in data compression algorithms
like bzip2. It rearranges the characters
in the input string to group similar
characters together, making it easier
to apply entropy encoding techniques.

6. **Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm
(LZMA)**: LZMA is a variant of the LZ77
compression algorithm that incorporates
additional features like dictionary size
optimization and a range of compression
 levels to achieve high compression ratios.

7. **Arithmetic Coding**: Arithmetic coding is a
more sophisticated form of entropy encoding
that encodes entire messages into a single
fractional number between 0 and 1. It's capable
of achieving better compression ratios than
Huffman coding but is also more complex.

8. **Dictionary Compression**: Dictionary
compression algorithms maintain a dictionary
of frequently occurring patterns or phrases
in the input data and replace them with shorter
codes. This approach is used in algorithms like
LZ77 and LZ78.

These techniques are commonly employed in various compression algorithms and file formats to achieve efficient data storage and transmission while minimizing resource usage. Understanding these strategies can be beneficial for designing efficient compression algorithms or understanding how existing compression techniques work.
